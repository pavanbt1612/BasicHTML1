        Few stories have stood the test of time like the Mahabharat. Composed over<mark><ins> 2,000 years ago</ins></mark>,this Indian epic is more than just a tale of war between cousins—it is a complex, multilayered journey through dharma (duty), karma (action), and the human condition.
        At its heart, the Mahabharat is a story of a royal family torn apart by ambition, pride, and fate.<br>
        But its richness lies in the characters it brings to life—each flawed, each noble in their own way.From the stoic Yudhishthira to the fiery Draupadi, the enigmatic Karna to the mischievous yet divine Krishna,
        the epic gives us not just heroes and villains, but real people navigating the grey areas of life.</p>

        <p style="color:rgb(76, 50, 4);">The seeds of <mark>the Mahabharat are sown in the kingdom of Hastinapur</mark>.The throne passes from one ruler to another, eventually leading to a division between
        the Pandavas—the five sons of King Pandu—and the Kauravas, the hundred
        sons of King Dhritarashtra.<br> 
        While both are technically of the same royal lineage,their ideologies and values set them on a collision course.What begins as rivalry grows into bitterness and betrayal, culminating in the great war of Kurukshetra—a 
        war that would change the fate of the known world.</p><hr>
